    <h2>Data Sources</h2>
    <p> 1.Status of achieving under-five mortality targets as of 2022 </p> 
    <p> 2. UN World Population Prospects, 2022 </p> 
    <p> 3. Antenatal care (ANC4) and skilled birth attendance (SBA) data </p> 

    <h2> Number of Records </h2>
    <p> * ANC4: 86 records </p> 
    <p> * SBA: 149 records </p> 


    <h2> Overview of Analysis </h2>
    <p> This analysis examines the differences in antenatal care coverage and skilled birth attendance rates based on whether a country has achieved the under-five mortality target as of 2022.
Population-weighted averages were calculated using the projected number of births in 2022 as weights.</p>

    <h2> Key Findings</h2>
    <p> 1. In countries that achieved the under-five mortality target, the proportion of women aged 15â€“49 who received at least four antenatal care visits (ANC4) was approximately 17.47 %p higher than in countries that did not. </p>
    <p> 2. In the same comparison, the proportion of deliveries attended by skilled health personnel (SBA) was approximately 23.81 % p higher in countries that achieved the target. </p>
    <p> 3. While frequent antenatal care visits play an important role in reducing under-five mortality, the larger difference observed in SBA coverage suggests that the presence of skilled birth attendants may have a greater impact than antenatal care alone.</p>
